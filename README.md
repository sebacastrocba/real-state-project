# **Real estate market analysis**

The objective of this project is to create a Machine Learning model that, given certain characteristics of the property, predicts its sale, rental or temporary rental price. In order to do so, the project was splitted in two parts: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Model Building. Model Building was performed in two different ways. 

The dataset was taken from [Properati](https://www.properati.com.ar/?utm_source=properati.com&utm_medium=direct)
